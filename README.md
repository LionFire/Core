# Roadmap

I am fleshing all this out for my own purposes as I need to and am inclined to, with the goal of creating components and frameworks that are useful in the long term.  While I intend for the frameworks and libraries to be decoupled, they may share some common interfaces that hopefully raise the lowest common denominator from the BCL, making some patterns possible that I intend to use heavily, such as multi-typing.

If you find a certain part interesting and want to help advance it into a first class library or framework, let me know.
