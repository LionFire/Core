.NET Core on Ubuntu 14.04: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaredthirsk/Core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaredthirsk/Core)

# LionFire.Core
Core utilities and frameworks for other LionFire packages

Overview and docs at https://lionfire.readthedocs.io

# ROADMAP

I am fleshing all this out for my own purposes as I need to and am inclined to, with the goal of creating components and frameworks that are useful in the long term.  While I intend for the frameworks and libraries to be decoupled, they may share some common interfaces that hopefully raise the lowest common denominator from the BCL, making some patterns possible that I intend to use heavily, such as multi-typing.

If you find a certain part interesting and want to help advance it into a first class library or framework, let me know.

# TODO

  - Get travis building 
  - Add travis-ci for mono
  - Move repo to LionFire org
